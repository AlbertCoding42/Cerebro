# AFUS-Cerebro
Cerebro will act as the “Mindmap” for InsightAC-1 which will visualize all data inputs for a user while utilizing the model. Cerebro is Spanish for “Brain” - our hope is to render a realistic representation of a human brain containing: neural networks &amp; data points. 


## Setup

Create a virtual environment. For example,
```
python3 -m venv ~/cerebro
```
Set the OpenAI key environment variable with the following command,
```
export OPENAI_API_KEY="api_key_here"
```
and finally run,
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
