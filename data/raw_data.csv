""What is a dash?""

A dash, in typographical terms, can refer to different types, such as an en dash (–) or an em dash (—).

Yeah, they mentioned the back-end. There's such a line in the front end where it even says 'hello world.' The message is 'hello world' from the front end. And then on the back end, there's nothing coming out.

**InsightAC:**It sounds like you might have a connectivity issue between the front-end and the back-end. Check if there are any network or configurations settings that might be interfering with the data transfer from the back-end to the front-end.

66d0b0ac59e7851c3f619e6d,"**User:**Yeah. So you should look at the front-end console and see if there's a point where it says beta 7. It should say something like data center back end, right? There should be some line in the front-end where it even has this ‘hello world’ message from the front-end. However, on the backend, nothing is appearing. Just

**InsightAC:**It sounds like there might be a disconnection between the front-end and back-end, or the API call from the front-end isn't reaching the back-end. Firstly, ensure that the front-end is correctly connected to the backend API. Check the network tab in the console to see if there are any failed requests. Also, verify if any errors are logged in the console that might provide more insight. Depending on your setup, you might need to look into CORS settings, API endpoint URLs, or potentially revisit the back-end to ensure it's running properly and able to respond to incoming requests.",2024-08-29T17:32:28.533Z
66d0b0f159e7851c3f619ea3,"**User:**But wait. If you put up your beta back end, you should see a 'Hello World' because I just made it and can send a front end.

66d0b08559e7851c3f619e5b,"**User:**Should the front end check first if the front-end logs say that it thinks it's been sent?

**InsightAC:**The front end should indeed check the logs to verify whether a message or signal has been sent. This can help in debugging and ensuring that the front-end operations are functioning correctly. If the logs indicate that the data was sent, but the expected outcome is not occurring, further investigation may be needed into backend handling or network issues.",2024-08-29T17:31:49.707Z

**InsightAC:**Ah, I see. It sounds like the issue might be related to the volume of contacts being retrieved, which is slowing down the OM process. Let's delve into this a bit more. When you say ""too many contacts,"" are we talking about a large dataset that's being fetched all at once? If so, have you tried implementing pagination or batching to manage the load more efficiently? This can help distribute the load more evenly and prevent performance issues. Additionally, reviewing the retrieval logic to optimize queries or considering a more efficient data handling strategy might also be beneficial.
